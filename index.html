        <p>
        I am now a third year Ph.D. student in computer science, co-advised by professor <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html">Frank Dellaert</a> and professor <a href="https://harishravichandar.com/">Harish Ravichandar</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to enrolling in computer science, I completed my master's program in Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech, and received my bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
        </p>
        <p>
        My current research interests cover various topics in robotics, including but not limited to robot motion planning, motion generation, and reactive motion policy learning. I am interested in learning motion policies from demonstrations and leveraging structured motion policy classes such as Riemannian Motion Policy and Geometric Fabrics to improve data efficiency.

      Manipulator dynamics is one of the most fundamental problems in robotics, and it is considered to be a well studied problem. Various different algorithms have been developed  to  solve  each  type  of dynamics problems, including inverse, forward and hybrid dynamics problems.  However,  they  are  not  easily  explained  in  a unified and intuitive way. In this project, our goal is to develop a unified method which solves all types of dynamics problems for robotic manipulators with either open kinematic chains or closed kinematic loops based on factor graphs.

      In this project, we introduce dynamics factor graphs as a graphical framework to solve dynamics problems and kinodynamic motion planning problems with full consideration of whole-body dynamics and contacts. A factor graph representation of dynamics problems provides an insightful visualization of their mathematical structure and can be used in conjunction with sparse nonlinear optimizers to solve challenging, highdimensional optimization problems in robotics. We can easily formulate kinodynamic motion planning as a trajectory optimization problem with factor graphs. We demonstrate the flexibility and descriptive power of dynamics factor graphs by applying them to control various dynamical systems, ranging from a simple cart pole to a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot.

  <h3>Modeling and Simulation for Soft Robotic Arms using Finite Element Method based on Factor Graphs</h3>

      Soft robots have contunuum solid bodies that is capable of deforming in an infinite number of ways, however, such property presents a formidable challenge to modeling and analysis. Many attempts have been made to establish a general modeling method for soft robots, and finite element method is one of the most popular methods, which has been widely used for both rigid and soft robots.  The FEM model can capture all the deformation information, and can represent the robot dynamics accurately. However, using such models is very difficult in a real-time system of control due to the heavy computation involved in solving FEM models. In this project, we are interested in developing FEM models with factor graphs, and taking advantages of the intuitive representation and efficient computation of factor graphs in solving either linear or nonlinear systems.
