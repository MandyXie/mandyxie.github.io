        <p>
        I am now a second year Ph.D. student in computer science, working with professor <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html">Frank Dellaert</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to joining computer science, I did my master program in aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech, and got my bachelor degree in mechanical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
        </p>
        <p>
        My current research interests cover various topics in robotics, include but not limit to manipulator dynamics, kinodynamic motion planning and soft robot modeling and simulation. I am interested in solving various robotics problems using factor graphs.

      Manipulator dynamics is one of the most fundamental problems in robotics, and it is considered to be a well studied problem. Various different algorithms have been developed  to  solve  each  type  of dynamics problems, including inverse, forward and hybrid dynamics problems.  However,  they  are  not  easily  explained  in  a unified and intuitive way. In this project, our goal is to develop a unified method which solves all types of dynamics problems for robotic manipulators with either open kinematic chains or closed kinematic loops based on factor graphs.

      In this project, we proposed a kinodynamic motion planner that is able to produce energy efficient motions by taking the full robot dynamics into account, and making use of gravity, inertia, and momentum to reduce the effort. Given a specific goal state for the robot, we use factor graph to solve a optimal trajectory, which meets not  only  the requirements  of  collision  avoidance,  but  also  all  kinematic  and dynamic  constraints,  such  as  velocity,  acceleration  and  torque limits.  By  exploiting  the  sparsity  in  factor  graphs,  we  can  solve a kinodynamic motion planning problem efficiently, on par with existing optical control methods, and use incremental elimination techniques to achieve an order of magnitude faster replanning

  <h3>Modeling and Simulation for Soft Robotic Arms using Finite Element Method based on Factor Graphs</h3>

      Soft robots have contunuum solid bodies that is capable of deforming in an infinite number of ways, however, such property presents a formidable challenge to modeling and analysis. Many attempts have been made to establish a general modeling method for soft robots, and finite element method is one of the most popular methods, which has been widely used for both rigid and soft robots.  The FEM model can capture all the deformation information, and can represent the robot dynamics accurately. However, using such models is very difficult in a real-time system of control due to the heavy computation involved in solving FEM models. In this project, we are interested in developing FEM models with factor graphs, and taking advantages of the intuitive representation and efficient computation of factor graphs in solving either linear or nonlinear systems.
